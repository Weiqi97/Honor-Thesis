\par Rubik's Cubes, estimated to be the world's besting-selling toy, is a fascinating puzzle that I believe most people have attempted to solve. However, as anyone who has tried knows, Rubik's Cubes are hard to solve. Cryptography shares the essence with playing Rubik's Cubes; to fix the scrambled pattern. In this thesis, we discuss the advantages and challenges of using the Rubik's Cube as the basis of an encryption system. 
\par We also test the Rubik's Cube encryption under the formal definition of security while seek additional opportunities provided by using 4 by 4 by 4 and larger cubes. Finally we construct a key-exchange protocol based on the Rubik's Cube using a structure similar to Diffie-Hellman key exchange.
