\chapter{The group structure of the cube}
A 3 by 3 by 3 cube has 6 fundamental moves. (Write out what they are.)
Claim that rubik's cube in Figure~\ref{fig:solved-cube} under its fundamental moves can be view as a group, in more details, a permutation group. Since essentially, what each movement of rubik's cube does is to send one cubie to another location. In order to illustrate this idea, we find a numbering system for it and we define the six fundamental moves as permutations.
