\chapter{Introduction}
The definition of cryptography given in the Webster dictionary is ``\textit{secret writing}''. This definition is historically precise. In ancient times, people apply the idea of cryptography mainly to secure their communications. (Mention that crypto used to be like some kind of puzzle, but now more based on math problems.) Also, the biggest motivation for people to research in this field and in fact, most applications of this field were all military related. Thus the term cryptography seemed far away from people's daily life.
