\chapter{Acknowledgments}\label{chap:acknowledgements}
\par I want to give a special thanks and my sincerest appreciation to my thesis advisor Professor Tommy Ratliff, who made this work possible. His insightful guidance and expert advice have been invaluable throughout all the stages of my work. He consistently allowed my creativity and independence to be shown in this thesis but steered me in the right direction whenever I needed it.
\par Then I want to express my gratitude to my committee member Professor Rachelle DeCoste and Professor Martin Gagn\'{e}. I also want to thank my dearest friend Fiona Xu and Heydrick Padilla for their endless support and accompany.
\par Finally, I must express my very profound gratitude to my parents and my grandparents for providing me with unfailing support and continuous encouragement throughout my years of study and through the process of researching and writing this thesis. This accomplishment would not have been possible without them.
